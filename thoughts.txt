cards = styling
notes = data

TODO what are models?
    -When adding note we set model id notes.py:20

Handling duplicates:
    ="duplicate" means has same main field
        ~for chinese cards this is chinese characters
    1. make sure other fields (but not media!) are different
        ~also check fields (like definitions) for ";"
            +if present, treat each ";" delimited section as a field
    2. for fields not the same, combine differences
        +separate with ";"


Steps:

In advance:
+Have utf-8 .txt csv input file 
+Have mostly empty anki collection (.anki2)
    +only thing inside is just the cards

--phase 1--

Could do this per line to save memory
{
1. read info from input file
    +for simplicity should just be utf-8 .txt csv file
    +each line becomes a JSON object

2. write objects to .json file
    +each line 1 json object
    +do not worry about duplicate values
}

--phase 2--

1.  copy collection
    +we reuse base collection anytime we run it
    =just regularly copy the files

1.5 initialize Collection object
    +use anki/storage.Collection() to init
        +just needs path (to copied file)
    +use this collection for everything now


2. ?load all json objects into memory
    ~need? to do this to check for duplicity
        -do we though?
    -alternative is do check as loading into db
    ~anki may have nicer tools for combining
        -no it doesn't but easier to check for duplicates that way

2. ? for each json object
{
    2.01 create note object (anki/notes.py)
    2.1  add to db
        +anki/collection.py: _Collection.addNote()
    2.15 ? check for duplicity?
}

3.  export to apkg file 
    +anki/exporting.py AnkiPackageExplorer.exportFiltered()



 . export collection to anki package
