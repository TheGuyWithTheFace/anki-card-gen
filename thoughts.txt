NEW IDEA:

+manipulate input.csv into correct format for anki import
    (anki can import from csv)

rearrange order:

input order:
English definition(sometimes multiple with commas in between),
Chinese character,
Pinyin ("encoded", numbers and symbols need to be converted to accented chars),
Word Type (needs to be expanded from n., v., v.-c., etc. into noun, verb,
    verb-complement, etc.) (could be multiple)
Lesson Number - always starts with L., change to V3_Ch##
page number - always starts with p., we can ignore this.

desired output
Chinese character,
Pinyin (accented chars)
English definition (even if multiple, all should be one field)
Sound? (for now, leave blank maybe but still with a comma?
Tags (expanded from Word Type), with added V3_Ch## based on Lesson number and a
    generated tag (could be helpful for debugging later)
